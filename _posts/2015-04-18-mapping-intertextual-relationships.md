Tracing the chain of remakes and references from the original _Cape Fear_ (1962) to "Mr. Burns: A Post-electric Play" in which characters re-tell an episode of _The Simpsons_ which parodies _Cape Fear_, I presented on how the relationships between remakes, parodies, and other intextual connections might be represented in the catalogs of libraries and archives. The presentation took place at "Extending Play: The Sequel" a media studies conference at Rutgers University.
