	<p>As part of my fellowship at the Guggenheim Museum, I supported the restoration of two web artworks: <i>Brandon</i> (commissioned by the museum in 1998) and <i>Unfolding Object</i> (commissioned in 2002). Read the blog posts I co-authored about the restoration process of <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/blogs/checklist/restoring-brandon-shu-lea-cheangs-early-web-artwork" target="new">Brandon</a> and <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/blogs/checklist/the-guggenheim-restores-john-f-simon-jr-early-web-artwork-unfolding-object" target="new">Unfolding Object</a>.</p> 
	<p>My graduate school thesis involved an in-depth study of malware preservation. The <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/tisch/preservation/program/student_work/2016spring/16s_thesis_farbowitz_final.pdf" target="new">full text</a> of the thesis is currently available through the NYU Moving Image Archiving and Preservation program's digital archive. You can also read a short article that summarizes my thesis research on <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-save-a-computer-virus-56967" target=new>The Conversation.</a></p>
