	<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am a graduate of New York University’s Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) program. I'm interested in preserving malware and other digital anomalies, archiving media related to social movements, discussing the ethical treatment of footage of Indigenous peoples in archival collections, and developing free and open-source software for archivists. I contributed to the development of <a href="https://github.com/amiaopensource/vrecord" target="new">vrecord</a>, open-source software for videotape digitization.</p>
	
	<p>I have worked on the collections of Anthology Film Archives, the Bancroft Library at University of California Berkeley, the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, City University Television (CUNY TV), the Museum of Modern Art, and NYU Libraries. In addition, I assessed and provided recommendations for digital preservation at Carnegie Hall.</p>
	
	<p>I am the former secretary of NYU’s Association of Moving Image Archivists (AMIA) student chapter and co-organized the <a href="https://apexsantiago.wordpress.com/" target="new">2016 Audiovisual Preservation Exchange</a> that took place in Santiago, Chile. Before starting the MIAP program, I worked as an application programmer analyst at Solutions for Progress and as a program associate at Scribe Video Center, both in Philadelphia. I have a bachelor’s degree in Film from Vassar College.</p>
