			<h1>About</h1>
	 <p>I am currently the Guggenheim Museum's Fellow in the Conservation of Computer-based Art where I assist the conservation department with preservation needs of computer-based artworks in the Guggenheim's collection. Along with preserving computer-based art, I'm also interested in preserving malware and other digital anomalies, archiving media related to social movements, discussing the ethical treatment of footage of Indigenous peoples in archival collections, and developing free and open-source software for archivists. In the past, I contributed to the development of <a href="https://github.com/amiaopensource/vrecord" target="new">vrecord</a>, open-source software for videotape digitization.</p>
	
	<p>In May 2016 I graduated from New York University’s <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/cinema-studies/courses/ma-in-moving-image-archiving-and-preservation" target="new">Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) program</a>. I have worked on the collections of Anthology Film Archives, the Bancroft Library at University of California Berkeley, the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, City University Television (CUNY TV), the Museum of Modern Art, and NYU Libraries. In addition, I assessed and provided recommendations for digital preservation at Carnegie Hall.</p>
	
	<p>While at NYU, I co-organized <a href="https://apexsantiago.wordpress.com/" target="new">2016's Audiovisual Preservation Exchange</a>, which took place in Santiago, Chile and attended <a href="https://apexbuenosaires.wordpress.com/" target="new">Audiovisual Preservation Exchange Buenos Aires</a> in 2015. In the past, I worked as an application programmer analyst at Solutions for Progress and as a program associate at Scribe Video Center, both in Philadelphia. I have a bachelor’s degree in Film (with a minor in Philosophy) from Vassar College.</p>
